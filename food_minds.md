## Food for hungry minds - The neural basis of feeding behavior

**Course description:** I co-created and co-led a course for undergraduate students at Harvard focused on the study of how brains control feeding behaviors. Below are a few of the tasks I was responsible for and skills I gained along the way! 

My work was recognized with two certificates of distinction in teaching for both semesters, awarded by the Office of Undergraduate Education at Harvard.

### 1. Course and syllabus design
I devised course structure and content and then designed syllabus infographics for students, explaining all relevant information about the course. 
Here are a couple of example pages:

A major learning objective for this course was for students to develop their ability to communicate tecnical knowledge to a variety of audiences and in multiple formats. 
Below you can find brief examples of some assignments:
