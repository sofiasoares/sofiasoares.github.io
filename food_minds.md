## Food for hungry minds - The neural basis of feeding behavior

**Course description:** I co-created and co-led a course for undergraduate students at Harvard focused on the study of how brains control feeding behaviors. Below are a few of the tasks I was responsible for and skills I gained along the way! 

My work was recognized with two certificates of distinction in teaching for both semesters, awarded by the Office of Undergraduate Education at Harvard.

### 1. Course and syllabus design
I devised course structure and content and then designed syllabus infographics for students, explaining all relevant information about the course. 
Here are a couple of example pages:

### 2. Assignment development
A major learning objective for this course was for students to develop their ability to communicate tecnical knowledge to a variety of audiences in written form. To achieve this, I created a wide variety of assignments that encouraged students to explore their writting from different perspectives.
Below I provide a few examples of assignment guidelines:

### 3. Class delivery and facilitation of classroom discussions
Another major focus of this course was to help students critically evaluate primary research articles and discuss them with their peers. With that in mind, I created and led a range of active learning exercises to facilitate these discussions including jigsaw, concept maps and group work. I used the expertise I gained through taking part in the Teaching Certificate program at the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, including their resources on [active learning](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/active-learning).
