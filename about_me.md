## About me

I am currently a Research Fellow in [Chris Harvey's lab](https://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachussets. I combine large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, novel behavioral paradigms, circuit manipulations, machine learning and neural networks to understand how information arises and is maintained across the cortex during learning.

Before moving to Boston, I obtained my Ph.D. in Joseph Paton's laboratory at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon, Portugal. There, I combined experimental tools (e.g. electrophysiological recordings, fiber photometry, optogenetics, pharmacology, chemogenetics), computational tools (e.g. dimensionality reduction methods, neuronal encoding and decoding models) with the design of novel behavioral paradigms, to study the contributions of striatal and midbrain dopamine neurons to animals' representations of time.

I am passionate about using my time to make positive change in society. I have worked and volunteered with a number of local, national and international organizations in the areas of social justice, education and global health and development.
In my free time, I love to hike, to cook and eat delicious food and discover new restaurants, to make music, and to spend time with my family and friends.
